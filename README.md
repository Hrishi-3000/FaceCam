# Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed. It provides additional details like the number of faces detected, frame rate, timestamp, and frame dimensions.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces with coordinates.
- Displays cropped face regions in a separate window.
- Displays frame rate, timestamp, and frame dimensions on the output.
- Simple to use and extend for advanced face detection tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV (cv2 library)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face_detection.git
